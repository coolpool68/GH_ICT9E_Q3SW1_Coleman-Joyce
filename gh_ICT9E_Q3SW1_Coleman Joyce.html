		<div class="col-xl-6 text-danger"> <center> SYNOPSIS </center></div>
		<div class="col-xl-6 text-danger"> Mensa-fied best friends and roommates Leonard and Sheldon, physicists who work at the California Institute of Technology, may be able to tell everybody more than they want to know about quantum physics, but getting through most basic social situations, especially ones involving women, totally baffles them. How lucky, then, that babe-alicious waitress/aspiring actress Penny moves in next door. Frequently seen hanging out with Leonard and Sheldon are friends and fellow Caltech scientists Wolowitz and Koothrappali. Will worlds collide? Does Einstein theorize in the woods? </div>

	 	</div>
	 	<div class="col-xl-6 text-danger">Sheldon is known for his brilliant mind but also his quirky behavior and idiosyncrasies. Sheldon has a hard time understanding sarcasm and is, with the exception of his close friends and wife Amy, uncomfortable with many social situations. Sheldon is extremely logical, but this comes at a cost of often being rude of condescending to others. Although Sheldon's friends are often the subject of his put downs and narcissistic behavior, they have generally learned to live with Sheldon's quirks.
